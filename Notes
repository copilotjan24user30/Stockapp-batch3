WishList
    emailId
    List <stock>
    

Test method 
  if you call the repo method it will affect the database -

    stockRepository.save(stock);   - it will create a new stock in the database



Service Layer
   will call the repository  
    repository will call the database - I don't want to call the database in the test method
    because my database is already tested
    so here I will do the Mockito to mock the repository 
    and inject the mock repository in the service layer
